    "### Question 5a: Model-based Error Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you did things correctly, it should look like fivethirtyeight has done \"pretty\" well with their forecasts: the actual fraction of wins tracks closely with the predicted number.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we decide what's \"good enough\"? Consider this example: I correctly predict that a coin is fair (e.g. that it has a 50% chance of heads, 50% chance of tails).  But if I flip it 100 times, I can be pretty sure it won't come up heads exactly 50 times.  The fact that heads didn't come up exactly 50 times doesn't make my prediction incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess how reasonable the predictions are, I need to quantify the uncertainty in my estimate.  It's reasonable to assume that within each bin, $k$, the observed number of wins, $Y_k \\sim \\text{Binomial}\\,(n_k, p_k)$, where $n_k$ is the number of elections and $p_k$ is the predicted win probability in bin $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical results tell us that the obseved fraction of wins in bin $k$, $\\hat p = \\frac{Y_k}{n_k}$ has variance $\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\hat p_k\\right) = \\frac{p_k (1-p_k)}{n_k} \\approx \\frac{\\hat p_k(1- \\hat p_k)}{n_k}$.  The standard deviation of the Binomial proportion then is $\\hat \\sigma_k \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat p_k(1- \\hat p_k)}{n_k}}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the [normal approximation to generate a confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Normal_approximation_interval), then the 95% interval has the form $\\hat p_k \\pm 1.96 \\hat \\sigma_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new \"aggregated\" dataframe named `election_agg`.  Take `election_sub`, group by `bin` and compute both the average of the `probwin_outcome` (`mean`) and the number of observations in each bin (`count`) using the `agg` function.  Call this new data frame, `election_agg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "THen, use the `mean` and `count` columns of `election_agg` to create a new column of `election_agg` titled `err`, which stores $1.96 \\times \\hat \\sigma_k$ in each bin $k$.\n",
